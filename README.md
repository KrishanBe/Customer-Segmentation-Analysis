# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

Project Overview: Customer Segmentation Analysis using K-means Clustering

The goal of this project is to perform customer segmentation analysis using the K-means clustering algorithm. The dataset contains information about customers' interactions and purchase behavior at a mall. The main objectives of this analysis are:

Target Customer Identification:
Identify customer segments that are more likely to converge and become target customers for the mall. This involves understanding the characteristics and preferences of different customer groups.

Marketing Strategy Planning:
Use the insights gained from customer segmentation to inform the marketing team's strategies. This includes tailoring marketing campaigns, promotions, and offerings to better meet the needs and preferences of different customer segments.

Enhanced Customer Experience:
Improve the overall customer experience by providing personalized services, recommendations, and incentives based on the identified customer segments.

Business Growth and Profitability:
By effectively targeting and catering to specific customer segments, the project aims to drive business growth, increase customer satisfaction, and ultimately enhance profitability for the mall.

The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering if needed, applying the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers, visualizing the clusters, and interpreting the results to derive actionable insights for the marketing and business strategy teams.
